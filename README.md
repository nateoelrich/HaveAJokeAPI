# Hi Hungry, I'm Dad
Welcome to the HaveAJokeAPI, we're we only give you dad jokes! Not because we don't know any other jokes, it's because they are the best jokes!

## Problem Statement
There should be two options the user can choose from:
1. Fetch a random joke.
2. Accept a search term and display the first 30 jokes containing that term. The matching term should be emphasized in some simple way (upper, quotes, angle brackets, etc.). The matching jokes should be grouped by length: Short (< 10 words), Medium (< 20 words), Long (>= 20 words).
